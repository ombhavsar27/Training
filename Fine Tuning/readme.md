## Overview

Fine-tuning is a critical step in transfer learning, allowing pre-trained models to adapt to specific tasks efficiently. This project:
- Implements fine-tuning of a Transformer-based model.
- Demonstrates the setup and training processes.
- Provides insights into evaluating the model's performance.

---

## Key Features

- Uses a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face library.
- Includes preprocessing steps for textual data.
- Demonstrates hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
- Provides detailed evaluation metrics for model performance.

---

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you need the following Python packages installed:

- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `datasets`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install transformers torch datasets scikit-learn numpy pandas
```

## Dataset Preparation

Ensure you have a labeled dataset in a format compatible with the Hugging Face `datasets` library. The dataset should be split into training, validation, and test sets. The notebook includes steps to preprocess the data before training.

## Notebook Overview

The `fine_tune_model.ipynb` notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. **Environment Setup**: Import necessary libraries and configure the environment.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, clean it, and tokenize the text.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face library.
4. **Fine-Tuning**: Train the model using the training dataset and validate it on the validation dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the test dataset and compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Visualization**: Plot the training and validation loss to monitor the training process.
